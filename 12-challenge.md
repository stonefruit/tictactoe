# Challenge

## EASY: Make the icons larger amd colorful

The X and O icons are really small compared to the boxes right now. Make them larger and give them different colors.

## MEDIUM: Complete winner checking algorithm

The game only checks for the first row at the moment. What other rules should tic tac toe have? Add them in!

## HARD: Color the winning boxes

While we know the game has ended and somebody won, we do not know which boxes contributed to the winning pattern.

Color the 3 boxes that allowed the win. Do not color the boxes that did not help with the win.
