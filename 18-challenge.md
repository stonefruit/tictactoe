## EASY-MEDIUM Hide the RESET button when all boxes are empty

When all the boxes are empty, the reset button does nothing useful. It is good user experience to only show buttons that do meaningful things. This is extra important in an application with many buttons as it gets hard to find the right button for the job.

Hide the RESET button, and show it only when a box is clicked.

## MEDIUM: Make it fancier when winning

The tic tac toe is functionally working now. However, the winning message is kind of boring. Make it look cooler! (don't forget to make sure reset still works properly)

## HARD: Let players enter their names instead of using PLAYER_1 and PLAYER_2

Wouldn't it be nice to use actual names instead of the default names in your game? Allow users to input their names for showing when they win!
