## EASY: Add your name somewhere on the page

Add your name somewhere on the page. Perhaps a title such as "Jerome's TIC TAC TOE" so everyone knows you did it?

## MEDIUM: Prettify the game

The tic tac toe looks pretty plain now. Add images and customize the icons to make it look better!

## HARD: Show a random string of letters when box is clicked

When playing against the computer, games usually use random numbers. For example, in Pokemon, you do not always encounter the same Pokemon.

While we do not create a computer player for this version of tic tac toe (we could next time!), creating randomness is quite easy with most programming languages, including javascript.

Make a random string of 8 characters appear instead of 'CLICKED!' when a box is clicked.
